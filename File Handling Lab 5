# File Handling Lab 5.

# Opening File Handles and reading data from files
print('''
This Lab is about opening a file handle, and 
reading the whole file into a big string.

You can read a file line by line, or put the 
whole file in as a single string.  This is an example 
of reading the whole file using the file method: 
- file_handle.read() method
      ''')
# Challenge 1
# Find the index that will print "red pill"
# sudo wget -O text-flie-matrix.txt https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jimTheSTEAMClown/Python-Class-STEAM-Clown/refs/heads/main/text-file-matrix.txt

Challenge # 1
----------------------------------------------------
Play with indexing the string to find the index 
location for "red pill" and print the location index 
and text "red pill" here:
      
Hint: You could find it by trial and error, or you 
could use a string method like .find()

# Find the index location for the text "red pill" and print the location index and text "red pill" here:

# Challenge Start here.
# I find the index of red pill by using whale.find('red pill'). The with the index, I print out the red pill.
# The number of digit in red pill is 8, so to print out the whole word I write print(whale[start index:start index + 8]
x = whale.find('red pill')
print(f'\nStart index of the red pill string is {x}')
print(f'End index of the red pill string is {x+8}')
print(f'So the total word will have the index {x}:{x+8}')
print('Lets print the word out!')
print(whale[x:x+8])

print('\nDone')
